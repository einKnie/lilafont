# lilafont

... and now for something completely different: a font!

### Installation & Usage

Simply double-click the __.ttf__ file to open the font manager and install via the GUI. 

Alternatively, you can install the font manually (on Linux) by copying the __.ttf__ file to _~/.local/share/fonts/_. Then, update your font config by calling ` fc-cache`.
